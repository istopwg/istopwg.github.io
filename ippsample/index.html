  <p>The <code>ippsample</code> project is based on the <a href="https://www.cups.org" target="_blank">CUPS</a> source code and is maintained by the <a href="https://www.pwg.org/ipp" target="_blank">PWG IPP workgroup</a>. The server implements most IPP standards including <a href="https://www.pwg.org/ipp/everywhere.html" target="_blank">IPP Everywhere&trade;</a> and includes transform support for 2D and 3D printing. A beta snap is available for Linux systems, with macOS and Windows binaries planned for the 1.0 release.</p>

<h2 id="about">About the IPP Sample Code</h2>

<p>This project provides sample implementations of IPP Clients, Printers, and Proxies. It is largely based upon the <a href="https://www.cups.org/" target="_blank">CUPS</a> software with substantial changes to the <code>ippproxy</code> and <code>ippserver</code> implementations to make them more general-purpose and configurable. The project also includes two transform programs, <code>ipptransform</code> for 2D printing and <code>ipptransform3d</code> for 3D printing, as well as a "lint" program (<code>ippdoclint</code>) for validating document data in automated test environments.</p>

<h2 id="programs">Programs</h3>

<h3 id="ippdoclint">ippdoclint <a class="badge badge-primary" href="ippdoclint.html">Man Page</a></h3>

<p>The <code>ippdoclint</code> program validates document data in a variety of formats, allowing for automated testing of IPP clients.</p>

<h3 id="ippfind">ippfind <a class="badge badge-primary" href="ippfind.html">Man Page</a></h3>

<p>The <code>ippfind</code> program implements Bonjour/DNS-SD discovery of IPP printers and can be used to find and test specific printers. Among other things, it is used as part of the <a href="../ippeveselfcert/index.html">IPP Everywhere&trade; Printer Self-Certification</a> test tools.</p>

<h3 id="ippproxy">ippproxy <a class="badge badge-primary" href="ippproxy.html">Man Page</a></h3>

<p>The <code>ippproxy</code> program implements a generic IPP Proxy interface that allows you to connect a local IPP, PCL, or G-code printer to an IPP Infrastructure Printer such as the <code>ippserver</code> program.</p>

<h3 id="ippserver">ippserver <a class="badge badge-primary" href="ippserver.html">Man Page</a></h3>

<p>The <code>ippserver</code> program implements most IPP standards and is commonly used for prototyping and automated testing. It provides a generic IPP Printer interface that allows you to share printers locally or using the IPP Shared Infrastructure Extensions. Printers can be configured to use authentication and/or to provide transforms using the included or third-party programs. A scriptable web interface allows for a variety of automated testing opportunities.</p>

<h3 id="ipptool">ipptool <a class="badge badge-primary" href="ipptool.html">Man Page</a> <a class="badge badge-secondary" href="ipptoolfile.html">Test File Format</a></h3>

<p>The <code>ipptool</code> program implements a generic IPP Client interface that allows a user to send different IPP requests and act based on the response from the Printer. Among other things, it is used as part of the <a href="../ippeveselfcert/index.html">IPP Everywhere&trade; Printer Self-Certification</a> test tools.</p>

<h3 id="ipptransform">ipptransform <a class="badge badge-primary" href="ipptransform.html">Man Page</a></h3>

<p>The <code>ipptransform</code> program is a generic file conversion utility that is used primarily with ippserver to support rasterization of JPEG and PDF documents for IPP Everywhere and HP PCL printers.</p>

<h3 id="ipptransform3d">ipptransform3d <a class="badge badge-primary" href="ipptransform3d.html">Man Page</a></h3>

<p>The <code>ipptransform3d</code> program is a generic file conversion utility that is used primarily with ippserver to support slicing of STL and 3MF documents for 3D printers connected via USB.</p>
