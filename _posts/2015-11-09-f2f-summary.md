3D Printing BOF
---------------

During the 3D Printing BOF we discussed adding attributes to track the amount of material used. We also reviewed the most recent version of the IPP extension white paper and decided to make changes to the "materials-col" Job Template attribute to support temperature, flow rate, and other material-specific settings. Finally, we decided to adopt the white paper as a new document for the IPP workgroup - the updated charter will be voted on by the PWG membership.

We will continue to discuss the white paper on the [3d-printing](https://www.pwg.org/mailman/listinfo/3d-printing) mailing list.


Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) Workgroup
------------------------------------------

We reviewed the IPP/1.1 RFC updates and IPP Everywhere Printer Self-Certification Manual. During the review of the IPP Everywhere Printer Self-Certification Manual, we decided how to manage new releases of the self-certification tools and to add references to the new Github project page for reporting issues in the tools.

The next Internet Printing Protocol conference call is on November 16, 2015 at 3pm ET / 12pm PT. Please see the [ipp](https://www.pwg.org/mailman/listinfo/ipp) mailing list for details.


Imaging Device Security (IDS) Workgroup
---------------------------------------

We reviewed the updated IDS charter and the publication of the new Hardcopy Device Protection Profile by the Common Criteria User's Forum. Pending new work, this workgroup will go into hibernation once the PWG Formal Vote of the TNC Binding specification is complete.

Please see the [ids](https://www.pwg.org/mailman/listinfo/ids) mailing list for further announcements.


Semantic Model (SM) Workgroup
-----------------------------

We discussed the pending charter update in PWG Formal Vote, prototyping efforts for the JDFMAP specification, and potential use of Github for joint maintenance of the PWG Semantic Model schema.

The next Semantic Model conference call is on November 30, 2015 at 3pm ET / 12pm PT. Please see the [sm3](https://www.pwg.org/mailman/listinfo/sm3) mailing list for details.
