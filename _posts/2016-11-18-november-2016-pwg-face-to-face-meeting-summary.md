The Printer Working Group November 2016 Face-to-Face meeting was held November 14-15, 2016. It was a "virtual face-to-face" meeting - all via teleconference / WebEx.  We discussed current and future liaisons with other groups, reviewed several drafts of in-progress specifications, discussed topics concerning printers / MFDs and Common Criteria (CC) testing and certification, and reviewed efforts to evolve the PWG Semantic Model. Below is a more detailed summary of the proceedings.
