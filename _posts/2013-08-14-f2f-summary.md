The Printer Working Group recently held a face-to-face meeting on August 6-8, 2013 at Sharp's facilities in Camas, WA. We discussed a potential 3D printing BOF, reviewed several drafts of in-progress specifications, and set new goals and milestones for the Cloud Imaging, Internet Printing Protocol, and Semantic Model workgroups. What follows is a summary of the proceedings.

Plenary
-------

During the plenary we reviewed the current workgroup and liaison status, a potential 3D printing BOF, and the upcoming W3C Workshop on Publishing.

There was interest in pursuing a 3D printing BOF in a future PWG Face-to-Face meeting so long as we are able to get participation from 3D printer manufacturers and solution providers. We will be reaching out to vendors to determine the level of interest in the coming month and will revisit this topic at the October 2013 Face-to-Face meeting. A new [3d-printing](https://www.pwg.org/mailman/listinfo/3d-printing) mailing list has also been created as a forum for discussion.

The W3C has invited the PWG to attend the [W3C Workshop on Publishing using the Open Web Platform](http://www.w3.org/2012/12/global-publisher/) in Paris, France. We are selecting two PWG representatives to attend this workshop and will be promoting the use of the PWG Semantic Model, Print Job Ticket, and the in-progress mapping technologies.


Cloud Imaging Workgroup
-----------------------

We discussed many of the logistical issues that have been delaying the Cloud Imaging effort. As a result of these discussions, we defined a short term milestone to complete the Registration portion of the Cloud Imaging Requirements and Model before the October 2013 Face-to-Face meeting. Additional incremental milestones will be defined to encourage smaller-scale participation from our busy members.

We also made major progress on defining the Registration process, decided which use cases will be in-scope for the model, and did a thorough review of all operations.

The next Cloud Imaging conference call is on August 26, 2013 at 3pm ET / 12pm PT. Please see the [cloud](https://www.pwg.org/mailman/listinfo/cloud) mailing list for details.


Imaging Device Security (IDS) Workgroup
---------------------------------------

We reviewed the latest draft of the MFP Protection Profile (PP) in a joint session with the Common Criteria (CC) Users' Forum MFP Technical Committee (TC). The new protection profile is being written to allow vendors to obtain a single certification that is accepted by all countries.

The next Imaging Device Security conference call is on August 19, 2013 at 2pm ET / 11am PT. Please see the [ids](https://www.pwg.org/mailman/listinfo/ids) mailing list for details.


Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) Workgroup
------------------------------------------

We discussed IPP Everywhere Self-Certification and reviewed the current drafts of the IPP FaxOut Service and IPP Implementors Guide 2.0. We also defined our future work for IPP multifunction support.

During our review of the IPP FaxOut Service, we made hardcopy document support recommended instead of required and resolved all but one of the pending issues identified during the last call. The one remaining issue concerns the terminating state of a job that was not sent successfully to its destination - this issue will be discussed on the IPP mailing list to determine the final resolution. After a short workgroup last call, the IPP FaxOut Service specification advance to PWG Formal Vote.

During our review of the IPP Implementors Guide 2.0, we determined that an errata for PWG 5100.7 (IPP Job Extensions) was needed in order to define a "job-mandatory-attributes-supported (boolean)" attribute. This will allow a Client to discover whether the Printer supports fine-grained fidelity in the job ticket.

Finally, we determined that the IPP Multifunction specification will be a "profile" specification, much like IPP Everywhere, and that we will continue developing separate service specifications for multifunction support.

The next Internet Printing Protocol conference call is on August 19, 2013 at 3pm ET / 12pm PT. Please see the [ipp](https://www.pwg.org/mailman/listinfo/ipp) mailing list for details.


Semantic Model (SM) Workgroup
-----------------------------

We reviewed an updated charter for the Semantic Model workgroup, including the Semantic Model v3.0, Semantic Model Orchestration v1.0, Semantic Model Transform Service v1.0, Resource Service v2.0, Imaging Job Ticket v3.0, and CWMP Printer Data Model specifications. We also discussed our participation in the upcoming W3C Workshop on Publishing using the Open Web Platform.

The next Semantic Model conference call is on August 26, 2013 at 2pm ET / 11am PT. Please see the [mfd](https://www.pwg.org/mailman/listinfo/mfd) mailing list for details.


Next Meeting
------------

We will hold our next meeting on October 22-24, 2013 at Ricoh's facilities in Cupertino, CA.
