The PWG held its May 2018 Face-to-Face meeting May 15-17, 2018 at
the Wild Palms Hotel in Sunnyvale, California. This event was held
in collaboration with
[Linux Foundation OpenPrinting Workgroup](http://www.linuxfoundation.org/collaborate/workgroups/openprinting).
Sessions were presented by both organizations over the event's 3 days.
Representatives from Apple, Artifex, Canon, Canonical, Google,
High North, HP Inc., IBM, Lexmark, Microsoft, Oki, Red Hat, Ricoh,
TIC, TCS and Xerox attended the meetings. Attendees present in
person and on the phone discussed liaisons with one another and
other groups, and reviewed work in progress, including drafts of a
number of in-progress specifications. Here is a summary of the
proceedings.

PWG Plenary
-----------

In the PWG Plenary, we reviewed the overall state of the PWG and
the status of its programs. We briefly discussed upcoming
face-to-face meeting planning, noting that attendance has been a
concern in the past for the events later in the year. We
considered both virtual and in-person meetings, and noted the need
for a survey to poll members and attendees for the viability and
timing of another in-person face-to-face meeting. We noted that
[there are now 272 printers certified](https://www.pwg.org/printers) under
the PWG's IPP Everywhere™ Self Certification program (it was 206 at the
start of the day!), with more purported to be on the way.

We also reviewed the status of the [IDS Workgroup](/ids/) and the
[IPP Workgroup](/ipp/), noting that the Imaging Device Security (IDS)
workgroup members have recently attended HCD TC meetings and that Paul
Tykodi had recently attended the RAPID + TCT Conference as a representative
of the PWG. It was observed that the PWG has recently sent a
request to advance RFC 8010 and RFC 8011 to full Internet Standard
status, which seems to be moving forward. Finally, we discussed
our liaison relationships with Trusted Computing Group (TCG),
IETF, Mopria, AMSC, ISO/IEC JTC1 3D Printing and Scanning Study
Group, possible collaboration with ISO TC 171 SC2, and possible
collaboration with IEEE P3030.

Linux OpenPrinting
------------------

In the Linux OpenPrinting sessions on the first day, Ira McDonald
led a review the status of the Linux OpenPrinting project and its
efforts, and reviewed the current major issues affecting printing
on Linux and other open source operating systems.&nbsp; Michael
Vrhel discussed the latest updates to Ghostscript and MuPDF and
reviewed why one might choose one over the other. Mike Sweet of
Apple reviewed the state of CUPS and outlined some of the upcoming
enhancements to that system, including a significant license
change, driver deprecation, and Print Applications coming in CUPS
2.3. Till Kamppeter of Canonical discussed the latest enhancement
to the "cups-filters" and "cups-browsed" projects, which support
technologies that have been removed from the core CUPS
distributions. Lastly, Aveek Basu of Lexmark discussed the Google
Summer of Code (GSoC) projects that Linux OpenPrinting has active
for 2018, and noted the contributions made by PWG members to
guiding the students' work.


Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) Workgroup
------------------------------------------

In the IPP WG sessions on the first day, we discussed 3D printing
related topics, continuing the liaison status updates from Paul
Tykodi, that led into a discussion of higher level file formats
such as 3D PDF, and also ISO Step-NC. We then reviewed the latest
drafts of IPP 3D Printing Extensions v1.1 and PWG Safe G-Code,
with contributions and comments from Kris Iverson of Microsoft.
The consensus was that the PWG is making good progress, and all
are hoping these documents and the prototyping work contributed by
Mike Sweet can help to further simplify and empower the client /
printer interactions between clients and desktop 3D printers.

On the second day, Ira led a status review, and then Mike Sweet
performed a sample code demonstration, showing off the support of
Shared Infrastructure Extensions support in "ippproxy" and other
tools. Next, Mike Sweet and Ira McDonald led a review of the
latest draft of IPP System Service. We reviewed the entire latest
draft, and the group believes it is making good progress toward a
stable draft, though a number of relatively minor changes were
identified. Following lunch, we reviewed the latest draft of IPP
Encrypted Jobs and Documents, in which we discussed the recently
published "eFail" vulnerabilities to S/MIME and PGP. We briefly
discussed the nature of those vulnerabilities and some
alternatives, then decided that none of us were qualified to
propose any alternatives. Smith volunteered to contribute some use
case topology diagrams to keep the effort scope on track, and the
group agreed to set this effort aside to wait for mitigations from
the S/MIME and PGP communities. Smith Kennedy then led a review of
the latest draft of the Job Reprint Password IPP Registration
document, where the group noted a number of editorial and other
issues. Finally, Mike Sweet led a review of the changes in the
latest draft of IPP Everywhere v1.1 and IPP Everywhere Self
Certification v1.1, when we also discussed some updates to the IPP
Everywhere Self Certification portal page.

On the afternoon of the third day, Mike Sweet led a review of the
latest draft of the "How to Use the Internet Printing Protocol"
mini-book, aimed at introducing newcomers to IPP concepts and
usage. Next, Smith Kennedy led a review of the latest draft of IPP
Authentication Methods, which contained some clarifications in the
OAuth2 section including a second "hybrid OAuth2 / HTTP Digest"
system (discussed and abandoned), as well as new content replacing
a number of lingering placeholders in the earlier drafts
concerning certificate management and life cycles. Finally, next
steps were considered.

Imaging Device Security (IDS) Workgroup
---------------------------------------

The IDS Workgroup had a session on the morning of the third day,
where notable developments in the HCD TC meetings and face-to-face
event in Trondheim, Norway, were reviewed. A number of new
requirements and changes were discussed in detail. There was
general agreement with the recommendations as to what changes
should go into the planned Version 1.1 “minor” update to the HCD
Protection Profile (PP) that is planned for November 2018, and
what changes should go into the next major update to the HCD PP.
Those present at the meeting supported the consensus of the HCD TC
that the TC’s next step should be to get the Common Criteria
Development Board to approve the formation of a HCD international
TC (iTC) from the HCD TC so that the next major update to the HCD
PP would be an HCD collaborative PP (cPP).

Next PWG Face-to-Face Meeting
-----------------------------

The PWG is still considering the exact time and location for its
next face-to-face event. A poll will be constructed to solicit
input from the membership. A link to that survey will be added to
the [PWG Meetings](/chair/meeting-info/meetings.html) page, where
information on upcoming meetings is listed.
