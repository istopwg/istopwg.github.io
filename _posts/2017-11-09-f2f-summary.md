PWG
---

In the PWG Plenary, we reviewed the state of the PWG, including the
results of the PWG officer election, upcoming events, and projects
hosted on the [PWG Github Site](https://github.com/istopwg).  We briefly
covered the status of each working group, noting that the Imaging
Device Security (IDS) working group will hold periodic meetings as part
of its new role to review and discuss issues implementing the new HCD
Protection Profile and other HCD standards. We noted that there were now
 206 printers certified under the IPP Everywhereâ„¢ Self Certification
program, and that more were purported to be on the way. We noted a shift
 in the CUPS Project's license and discussed whether it was appropriate
for the PWG to mirror that shift. We
discussed our liaison relationships with Trusted Computing Group (TCG),
Mobile Platform Workgroup (MPWG), IETF, Mopria, ISO/IEC JTC1, ISO TC 130 and AMSC. We had an open discussion about new work areas and unaddressed needs.


Imaging Device Security (IDS) Workgroup
---------------------------------------

In the IDS WG session, we reviewed the NIAP direction implementing
the changes to NIST SP800-131A and NIST SP800-56B. We also discussed
password requirements in the HCD Protection Profile and in the NIST SP
800-171. Updates to the HCD PP are planned by the HCD TC, and the
planned changes were reviewed.

Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) Workgroup
------------------------------------------

In the IPP WG sessions, Ira McDonald presented the latest draft of
the IPP System Service specification. Smith Kennedy presented the latest
drafts of "IPP Get-User-Printer-Attributes Operation", "IPP Presets" and
"IPP  Authentication Methods" white papers. IPP Get-User-Printer-Attributes
and IPP Presets entered IPP WG Last Call soon after the F2F event.

Future work was also discussed, including enhancements to the PWG's
"ippsample" project in its Github site and collaboration on projects
with the Linux OpenPrinting team.
