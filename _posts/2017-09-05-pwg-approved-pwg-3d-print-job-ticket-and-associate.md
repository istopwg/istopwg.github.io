The PWG 3D Print Job Ticket and Associated Capabilities v1.0 (PJT3D) document has been approved as a Best Practices document. This document describes the PWG Semantic Model Print3D service schema for embedded Job Tickets. The schema is based on the IPP 3D Printing Extensions v1.0 (3D) and suitable for data exchange and embedding within common 3D file formats such as 3MF and 3D PDF documents so that user intent is preserved regardless of the transport or workflow used.

The published Best Practices document can be found at:
