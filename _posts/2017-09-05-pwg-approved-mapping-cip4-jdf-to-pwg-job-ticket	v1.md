PWG Mapping CIP4 JDF to PWG Job Ticket v1.0 (JDFMAP) has been approved as a Best Practices recommendation.

For interoperability between job ticket-based printing systems, this document defines a recommended mapping from XML objects and attributes in the CIP4 Job Definition Format [CIP4JDF] to XML elements in the PWG Print Job Ticket and Associated Capabilities [PWG5108.7].
