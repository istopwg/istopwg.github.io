Wireshark 2.4.0, which was announced on July 19, 2017, is now available for
download. This release includes a much improved IPP dissector, which
will benefit all who are inspecting IPP traffic in Wireshark. The new
dissector properly labels IPP requests and responses, includes links to
the corresponding responses and HTTP traffic. It also provides a much
better presentation of the attributes within the IPP operation requests
and responses, so the information is easier to read and navigate. This
release should benefit all who spend time examining IPP traffic in
Wireshark and those that use Wireshark's tools to gather and monitor IPP
traffic.

Thanks to Mike Sweet for contributing the dissector code updates!
