PWG Candidate Standard 5110.3-2013: PWG Common Log Format (PWG-LOG) defines a common log format for hardcopy device events that can be used with existing logging protocols such as SYSLOG. While the focus of this format is on security and auditing of devices, it also supports logging of arbitrary events such as those defined by the IPP Event Notifications and Subscriptions (RFC 3995) specification.
