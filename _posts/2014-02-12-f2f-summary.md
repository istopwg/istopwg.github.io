The Printer Working Group recently held a face-to-face meeting on February 4-6, 2014 at Samsung's facilities in Irvine, CA. We discussed current and future liaison's with other standards groups, reviewed several drafts of in-progress specifications, and enjoyed presentations from CIP4 and the Mopria Alliance. What follows is a summary of the proceedings.

Plenary
-------

During the plenary we reviewed the current workgroup and liaison status, discussed possible venues for the August 2014 F2F in Toronto, and discussed obtaining an Appointed Membership for the PWG in CIP4 for our ongoing JDF mapping work.


Cloud Imaging Workgroup
-----------------------

We reviewed the current draft of the Cloud Imaging Requirements and Model specification. The review identified some editorial issues, slightly expanded the GetServiceNotifications response data for terminated jobs, and eliminated the GetCloudTerminatedJobs operation that is no longer necessary.

The next Cloud Imaging conference call is on February 17, 2014 at 3pm ET / 12pm PT. Please see the [cloud](https://www.pwg.org/mailman/listinfo/cloud) mailing list for details.


Imaging Device Security (IDS) Workgroup
---------------------------------------

We reviewed the latest TNC Binding draft, identifying several editorial issues, and reviewed the latest comments and responses for the MFP Protection Profile (PP). We will continue to review the MFP PP status at future IDS meetings.

The next Imaging Device Security conference call is on March 3, 2014 at 2pm ET / 11am PT. Please see the [ids](https://www.pwg.org/mailman/listinfo/ids) mailing list for details.


Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) Workgroup
------------------------------------------

We reviewed the current drafts of IPP Everywhere Self-Certification, IPP Implementors Guide v2.0, and IPP Scan Service.

During the review of the IPP Everywhere Self-Certification Manual 1.0, we decided to defer WS-Discovery testing in the 1.0 manual and will issue at least one more interim draft before advancing the manual to prototype status. We also decided that self-certification results will be submitted to two PWG officers of the submitter's choice, mirroring the anonymous prototyping process allowed for PWG specifications. Public information of approved products will be limited to manufacturer, product family/models, the version of self-certification completed, a URL provided by the submitter, and a list of any exceptions that have been granted (numbered without specifics).

During our review of the IPP Implementors Guide v2.0, we discussed conformance requirements and prototyping requirements, with the latter showing prototype experience for the recommended operations/techniques. Once the editorial changes have been made, this document will be ready to move to prototype status.

During our review of the IPP Scan Service, we discussed discovery, spooling, and push requirements and updated the names of some attributes. Discussion of the push scan requirements continues on the IPP mailing list. Once the editorial and push requirements are resolved, this document will be ready to move to prototype status.

The next Internet Printing Protocol conference call is on March 3, 2014 at 3pm ET / 12pm PT. Please see the [ipp](https://www.pwg.org/mailman/listinfo/ipp) mailing list for details.


Semantic Model (SM) Workgroup
-----------------------------

We had a presentation on JDF from Rainer Prosi representing CIP4 and a presentation from Brent Richtsmeier on the Mopria Alliance. We also discussed specific JDF mapping issues and terminology differences, for example JDF Intent vs SM Intent, and some issues with the current SM schema related to the Scan service.

The next Semantic Model conference call is on February 17, 2014 at 2pm ET / 11am PT. Please see the [sm3](https://www.pwg.org/mailman/listinfo/sm3) mailing list for details.


Next Meeting
------------

We will hold our next meeting on May 13-16, 2014 at Apple's facilities in Cupertino, CA.
