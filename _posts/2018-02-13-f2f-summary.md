PWG
---

In the PWG Plenary, we reviewed the state of the PWG, including
noting pending merger between Xerox and Fuji Xerox.
We briefly covered the status of each working group, noting that the
Imaging Device Security (IDS) workgroup will hold periodic meetings as
part of its new role to review and discuss issues implementing the new HCD
Protection Profile and other HCD standards. We noted that there are
206 printers certified under the IPP Everywhere™ Self Certification
program, more are purported to be on the way, and that an update to the
IPP Everywhere™ Self Certification Suite will be coming in 2018. We
briefly reviewed a number of new initiatives for IPP coming in 2018. We
discussed our liaison relationships with Trusted Computing Group (TCG),
IETF, Mopria, AMSC, ISO/IEC JTC1 3D Printing and Scanning Study Group,
possible collaboration with ISO TC 171 SC2, and possible collaboration
with IEEE P3030.


Imaging Device Security (IDS) Workgroup
---------------------------------------

The IDS WG did not have any sessions. There will be a number of updates and discussions at the PWG May 2018 F2F.


Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) Workgroup
------------------------------------------

In the IPP WG sessions, we discussed in more detail some of the
liaison relationships between the PWG and various SDOs developing 3D
printing standards. Mike Sweet led a review and discussion of a new
"Welcome to Printing with IPP" mini-book, aimed at introducing newcomers
to IPP. Smith Kennedy presented his latest draft of IPP Job Save
Password, and this discussion included a side topic about IPP and GDPR
and the privacy of Job Description attributes. Mike Sweet showed some
documentation of CUPS policy settings that can control the visibility of
various Job Description attributes, and he proposed a new IPP
Registration named "IPP Privacy Attributes" where attributes for
controlling this might be defined. Smith and Mike then led a discussion
of proposals for schemes for IPP document encryption.

On the second day, Ira McDonald and Mike Sweet presented their latest draft
of the IPP System Service specification. Smith
Kennedy briefly presented an updated drafts of his "IPP
Authentication Methods" white paper and there was a discussion of
OAuth2. IPP Everywhere Self Certification 1.1 planning and scope was
