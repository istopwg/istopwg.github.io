PWG Candidate Standard 5110.2-2013: PWG Hardcopy Device Health Assessment Network Access Protection Protocol Binding (HCD-NAP) defines the application of security policy enforcement mechanisms to imaging devices. This document specifies how the Microsoft Network Access Protection (NAP) protocol is to be used, along with the set of health assessment attributes created especially for HCDs, to allow access to such devices based upon the locally defined security policy.
