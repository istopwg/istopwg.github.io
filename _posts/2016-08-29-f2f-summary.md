The Printer Working Group August 2016 Face-to-Face meeting was held
August 23-24, 2016 at Sharp Lab's facilities in Camas, Washington.
We discussed current and future liaisons with other groups, reviewed
several drafts of in-progress specifications, discussed topics
concerning printers / MFDs and Common Criteria (CC) testing and
certification, and reviewed efforts to evolve the PWG Semantic Model.
Below is a more detailed summary of the
proceedings.

PWG Plenary
-----------

In the PWG Plenary, we discussed several topics relevant to the PWG
membership community. First, an effort has begun to update the PWG
Process document to version 4, to incorporate a number of policy
documents that have been authored since the approval of the PWG Process
3.0 process document, which was approved in 2006. Some discussion on how
this should proceed, including some thoughts from Smith Kennedy and Ira
McDonald concerning keeping some of the current policy documents as-is
and using the Process v4 document as a "framework" document, was
discussed. Also, a new whitepaper was proposed outlining the
design principles and core design ethos of the PWG. This would be
useful for both those active in PWG standards development, those
implementing IPP in their products, and those considering IPP and
wanting to understand why the PWG chose to structure its technologies
the way that it does.

Following that, the Working Group chairs from the IPP WG,
Semantic Model WG, and Imaging Device Security WG reviewed the status of
their Working Group. Although the IDS working group was or is in
hibernation, it has been awakened from its slumber to discuss some of
the Common Criteria HCD Protection Profiles. We discussed the IPP
Everywhere Self Certification site and process, which is now live,
and two upcoming updates to the IPP Everywhere Self Certification
tools (1.0 Update 1 and 1.1). No printers have yet certified. Ira
described our liaison relationship with Trusted Computing Group.
Finally, Paul Tykodi discussed his experiences representing the PWG
at Drupa, where he presented a talk on 3D printing and IPP and the
value of open standards in 3D printing ecosystems. Paul also discussed
dialogs he had with representatives from Gartner about 3D printing.


Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) Workgroup
------------------------------------------

We reviewed the IPP/1.1 RFC updates and the latest drafts of the
IPP System Service, IPP 3D Printing Extensions, and the IPP Finishings
2.1 specifications.

We noted the updates to IPP/1.1 (RFC 2910bis /
RFC 2911bis) were either already approved or nearing approval. We
reviewed the most recently updated draft
of the IPP System Service, which continues to make good progress toward
reaching
a prototype state. We discussed the latest revision of the
IPP 3D Extensions, which is in Prototype state. Finally, we
reviewed the
latest draft update to 5100.1 (a.k.a. "Finishings 2.1"), which has
achieved Stable draft status and is in Working Group Last Call until
September 6, 2016. A few editorial fixes were identified, which
will be corrected in a follow-up Stable draft once the Working Group
Last Call is complete.

The next IPP Working Group conference call for IPP 3D Printing Extensions
is on September 12, 2016 at 4pm ET / 1pm PT. The next IPP Working Group conference call for 2D printing topics
is on September 19, 2016 at 3pm ET / 12pm PT. Please subscribe to the [ipp](https://www.pwg.org/mailman/listinfo/ipp) mailing list for details.


Imaging Device Security (IDS) Workgroup
---------------------------------------

In the Imaging Device Security Working Group session, the attendees
discussed the new Common Criteria Hardcopy Device (HCD) Protection
Profile (PP) and the problems they have encountered with qualifying
their products against this profile. We discussed issues such as the use
of Solid State Drives, how requirements in the PP are being interpreted
by the US and Japan, use of a true random number generator, and
concerns about producing the entropy and other documentation required by
this PP. We also discussed the US process for obtaining interpretations
to PPs in general and how we can make that process more timely and more
effective. Finally, we talked about the possibilities of forming a
group of HCD vendors to assist the US is working issues with the new PP,
the possibility of turning the PP into a PWG standard and the current
status of turning this bilateral HCD PP between the US and Japan into an
international PP.

No future meeting was planned but we did discuss the possibility of
having monthly IDS conference calls on these topics starting in
September.


Semantic Model (SM) Workgroup
-----------------------------

In the Semantic Model Working Group session, we discussed a range of
topics. We first discussed the effort to encode a PWG Print Job
Ticket into a 3MF 3D model file. Following that, there was a discussion
of the effort to finalize the Semantic Model v2 (SM2). And
finally, the work on Semantic Model v3 (SM3) was discussed.

The next Semantic Model Workgroup conference call will be at 3PM EDT, September 12, 2016.


Next Face-to-Face Meeting
-------------------------

We will hold our next PWG Face-to-Face meeting November 15-16, 2016
hosted at Lexmark's facilities in Lexington, KY. Information on
upcoming meetings as always is listed on the [PWG's Meetings page](/chair/meeting-info/meetings.html).
