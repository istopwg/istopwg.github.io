PWG MFD Alerts v1.1 (MFD Alerts) has been approved as PWG Candidate Standard 5107.3-2019.

This specification updates the previously approved 5107.3 candidate standard defining an update to the IANA-PRINTER-MIB (originally published in RFC 3805) to provide support for SNMP alerts in a multifunction device (MFD) and an equivalent update to IPP "printer-state-reasons" [STD92] and IPP "printer-alert" [PWG5100.9].
