    <h3>PWG 5100.1-2017: IPP Finishings 2.1 (FIN) <a class="badge badge-primary" href="https://ftp.pwg.org/pub/pwg/candidates/cs-ippfinishings21-20170217-5100.1.pdf">PDF</a></h3>
    <p>This specification defines new &ldquo;finishings&rdquo; and &ldquo;finishings-col&rdquo; Job Template attribute values to specify additional finishing intent, including the placement of finishings with respect to the corners and edges of portrait and landscape documents.</p>


    <h3>PWG 5100.2-2001: IPP &quot;output-bin&quot; attribute extension <a class="badge badge-primary" href="https://ftp.pwg.org/pub/pwg/candidates/cs-ippoutputbin10-20010207-5100.2.pdf">PDF</a></h3>
    <p>This document defines an extension to the Internet Printing Protocol/1.0 (IPP/1.0) [RFC2566, RFC2565] &amp; IPP/1.1 [RFC2911, RFC2910] for the OPTIONAL &ldquo;output-bin&rdquo; (type2 keyword | name(MAX)) Job Template attribute. This attribute allows the client to specify in which output bin a job is to be placed and to query the Printer&lsquo;s default and supported output bins.</p>


    <h3>PWG 5100.3-2001: Production Printing Attributes - Set 1 <a class="badge badge-primary" href="https://ftp.pwg.org/pub/pwg/candidates/cs-ippprodprint10-20010212-5100.3.pdf">PDF</a></h3>
    <p>This document specifies an extension to the Internet Printing Protocol/1.0 (IPP) [RFC2565, RFC2566] and IPP/1.1 [RFC2910, RFC2911]. This extension consists primarily of Job Template attributes defined for submitting print jobs primarily (but not limited to) to production printers. These attributes permit a user to control and/or override instructions in the document content to perform the following functions: print on document covers, control the positioning of stapling, force pages to the front side of the media, identify an imposition template, insert sheets into the document, provide an accounting id, provide an accounting user id, request accounting sheets, provide job sheet messages, request error sheets, provide a message to the operator, control the media used for job sheets, request media by characteristic (size, weight, etc.), request to check the media characteristics in an input tray, specify the presentation direction of page images with number-up, and shift the images of finished pages.
    </p>
    <p>This extension also defines the &ldquo;current-page-order&rdquo; Job Description attribute, the &ldquo;user-defined-values-supported&rdquo; and &ldquo;max-stitching-locations-supported&rdquo; Printer Description attributes, and the &lsquo;resources-are-not-supported&rsquo; value for the &ldquo;job-state-reasons&rdquo; Job Description attribute. Some additional &ldquo;media&rdquo; keyword values are defined for use with the &ldquo;media&rdquo; and &ldquo;media-col&rdquo; Job Template attributes.</p>


    <h3>PWG 5100.5-2019: IPP Document Object v1.1 <a class="badge badge-primary" href="https://ftp.pwg.org/pub/pwg/candidates/cs-ippdocobject11-20190521-5100.5.pdf">PDF</a></h3>
    <p>This specification defines the IPP Document object and its associated attributes, values, group, and operations.</p>


    <h3>PWG 5100.6-2003: IPP Page Overrides <a class="badge badge-primary" href="https://ftp.pwg.org/pub/pwg/candidates/cs-ipppageoverride10-20031031-5100.6.pdf">PDF</a></h3>
    <p>This IPP specification extends the IPP Model and Semantics [rfc2911] object model by relaxing the restriction that each attribute value is the same for all pages within a Document. For example, with this extension, page 1 of a job could have a different media than the other pages in the job.
    </p>
    <p>This extension supports page Overrides by adding a new Job Template attribute: &ldquo;overrides&rdquo;. Each &lsquo;collection&rsquo; value contains attributes that identify the attributes to Override and their associated values as well as the range of pages for the Override. The range of pages is specified by the &ldquo;document-copies&rdquo; attribute and the &ldquo;pages&rdquo; attribute to allow Overrides of pages in specific copies of the document.
    </p>
    <p>This specification obsoletes 5100.4-2001, “Override Attributes for Documents and Pages”.</p>


    <h3>PWG 5100.7-2019: IPP Job Extensions v2.0 (JOBEXT) <a class="badge badge-primary" href="https://ftp.pwg.org/pub/pwg/candidates/cs-ippjobext20-20190816-5100.7.pdf">PDF</a></h3>
    <p>This specification defines the "media-col" Job Template attribute and extends the Job management, monitoring, and processing capabilities of IPP.</p>


    <h3>PWG 5100.8-2003: IPP &quot;-actuals&quot; Attributes <a class="badge badge-primary" href="https://ftp.pwg.org/pub/pwg/candidates/cs-ippactuals10-20030313-5100.8.pdf">PDF</a></h3>
    <p>This document defines an extension to the Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) (RFC2911, RFC2910) for the OPTIONAL &ldquo;-actual&rdquo; set of Job Description attributes that correspond to Job Template attributes defined in IPP. These &ldquo;-actual&rdquo; attributes allow the client to determine the true results of a print job regardless of what was specified in the Create-Job or Print-Job operation.</p>


    <h3>PWG 5100.9-2009: IPP Printer State Extensions v1.0 <a class="badge badge-primary" href="https://ftp.pwg.org/pub/pwg/candidates/cs-ippstate10-20090731-5100.9.pdf">PDF</a></h3>
    <p>This document defines the new IPP Printer attributes &ldquo;printer-alert&rdquo; and &ldquo;printer-alert-description&rdquo; plus extensions to the IPP Printer attribute &ldquo;printer-state-reasons&rdquo; (defined in RFC 2911) and to the IANA Printer MIB textual convention &ldquo;PrtAlertCodeTC&rdquo; (originally published in RFC 3805) as follows:
    </p>
    <p>(a) A standard encoding of all of the machine-readable columnar objects in the &lsquo;prtAlertTable&rsquo; defined in IETF Printer MIB v2 (RFC 3805) into substrings of values of the new IPP Printer &ldquo;printer-alert&rdquo; attribute defined in this document.
    </p>
    <p>(b) A standard encoding of the localized &lsquo;prtAlertDescription&rsquo; columnar object in the &lsquo;prtAlertTable&rsquo; defined in IETF Printer MIB v2 (RFC 3805) into values of the new IPP Printer &ldquo;printer-alert-description&rdquo; attribute defined in this document.(c) A standard mapping between the device errors and warnings in the &lsquo;PrtAlertCodeTC&rsquo; textual convention defined in IANA Printer MIB and existing or new values (as needed) of the IPP Printer &ldquo;printer-state-reasons&rdquo; attribute defined in IPP/1.1.
    </p>
    <p>(d) A standard mapping between the finishing subunit types in the &lsquo;FinDeviceTypeTC&rsquo; textual convention defined in IANA Finisher MIB (originally published in RFC 3806) and new specific values of the &lsquo;PrtAlertCodeTC&rsquo; textual convention defined in IANA Printer MIB and new values of the IPP Printer &ldquo;printer-state-reasons&rdquo; attribute defined in IPP/1.1, for high fidelity support of finishing alerts.</p>


    <h3>PWG 5100.11-2010: IPP Job and Printer Extensions - Set 2 (JPS2) <a class="badge badge-primary" href="https://ftp.pwg.org/pub/pwg/candidates/cs-ippjobprinterext10-20101030-5100.11.pdf">PDF</a></h3>
    <p>This Job and Printer Extensions - Set 2 Specification (JPS2) defines an extension to the Internet Printing Protocol/1.0 (IPP) ([RFC2565], [RFC2566]), IPP/1.1 ([RFC2910], [RFC2911]), and [RFC3380]. This JPS2 consists of a REQUIRED Job Template attribute to print a proof print(s) of the job prior to printing the full run of the job and OPTIONAL Job Template attributes for submitting print jobs that permit a user to save jobs for later reprinting (i.e., retain the jobs indefinitely), provide a recipient name and a job phone number, provide the feed orientation, provide the font name and font size, hold a job until a specific date and time, delay the output of a job (but allow processing) until a specified time period, delay the output of a job (but allow processing) until a specific date and time, and specify an interpreter initialization file.
    </p>
    <p>This JPS2 also defines four new REQUIRED operations - Cancel-Jobs, Cancel-My-Jobs, Close-Job, and Resubmit-Job - and a new REQUIRED &ldquo;job-ids&rdquo; operation attribute to be used with the existing Get-Jobs and Purge-Jobs operations. Cancel-Jobs allows an operator/administrator to cancel a list of Not Completed jobs or all Not Completed jobs on the Printer. Cancel-My-Jobs allows a user to cancel a list of their Not Completed jobs or all their Not Completed jobs. Close-Job allows a client to close a multi-document job without supplying any additional documents (to support streaming clients and servers). Resubmit-Job allows a user to re-process a modified copy of a Retained Job. Get-Jobs with the &ldquo;job-ids&rdquo; attribute allows a user to get a list of jobs. Purge-Jobs with the &ldquo;job-ids&rdquo; attribute allows an operator/administrator to purge a list of jobs. There are also Printer Description attributes to list the Job Creation attributes supported indicate whether jobs are spooled and list the set of media collections supported. In addition, conformance to JPS2 also REQUIRES support of the Reprocess-Job operation defined in [RFC3998].
    </p>
    <p>Some of the Job Template attributes defined in this specification are also defined to be supplied as Operation attributes in the Hold-Job ([RFC2911]) and Set-Job-Attributes ([RFC3380]) operations.
    </p>
    <p>In addition, OPTIONAL semantics for Attribute Precedence, a Queue Override Feature, and a feature to guarantee protocol precedence over the PDL attribute are defined.</p>

    <h3>PWG 5101.2-2004: PWG RepertoireSupported Element <a class="badge badge-primary" href="https://ftp.pwg.org/pub/pwg/candidates/cs-crrepsup10-20040201-5101.2.pdf">PDF</a></h3>
    <p>In traditional printing environments, clients rely on font downloads when they are not sure a given character is embedded in the printer. As printing moves to small clients, downloading may not be an option and clients have a need to know what characters are available in a given device.
    </p>
    <p>There are many published named character repertoires, and a small client will not know about them all.
    </p>
    <p>To improve operability, this document defines semantics and naming conventions to allow a printer to advertise what repertoires it supports.
    </p>
    <p>The primary target of this document is printing using document formats based on XML or HTML (for example, XHTML-Print). It will be less applicable to traditional PDLs (PCL, PostScript, etc.) because they tend to have very format-specific mechanisms for managing character repertoires.</p>


    <h3>PWG 5101.4-2004: Universal Printer Description Format <a class="badge badge-primary" href="https://ftp.pwg.org/pub/pwg/candidates/cs-upd10-20040526-5101.4.pdf">PDF</a></h3>
    <p>This document describes the concept of a Universal Printer Description Format and the set of schemas it is based on. The schemas describe input for a driver/client to assemble general information about the device and its features, to be used in user interfaces or for printing.</p>

    <p>HTML 4 is a powerful language for authoring Web content, but its design does not take into consideration issues pertinent to printers, including the implementation cost (in power, memory, etc.) of the full feature set. Printers have relatively limited resources that cannot generally afford to implement the full feature set of HTML 4.
    </p>
    <p>Because there are many ways to subset HTML, there are many almost identical subsets defined by organizations and companies. Without a common base set of features, developing print applications for a wide range of printers is difficult.
    </p>
    <p>XHTML-Print&lsquo;s targeted usage is for printing in environments where it is not feasible or desirable to install a printer-specific driver and where some variability in the formatting of the output is acceptable.
    </p>
    <p>The document type definition for XHTML-Print is implemented based on the XHTML modules defined in the W3C&rsquo;s Modularization of XHTML.</p>

    <p>This document specifies an application of PDF (Portable Document Format) that has two important properties: First, it is an &ldquo;image&rdquo;-based format, and proper rendering of the document is represented by (binary or color) images. Second, the format is suitable for incremental generation and thus it is a &ldquo;streaming&rdquo; format. The subset is called &ldquo;PDF/is&rdquo;, for &ldquo;PDF Image-Streamable&rdquo;.</p>

    <p>This specification defines the abstract Web-based Imaging Management Service (WIMS) protocol. This specification defines five operations initiated by a WIMS Agent (embedded in services or devices), largely in support of Schedule-oriented remote management: RegisterForManagement (Agent allows management by an identified WIMS Manager); and UnregisterForManagement (cancel Agent association with a given WIMS Manager); GetSchedule (request a Schedule of planned actions); SendReports (send normal operational message); and SendAlerts (send warning or error exception message). This specification also defines four operations initiated by a WIMS Manager to support more conventional local management: BeginManagement (Manager requests ability to manage an identified Agent); EndManagement (Manager cancels association with Agent); SetSchedule (send a Schedule of planned actions with their timetables); ExecuteAction (execute the single identified action). This specification also defines sets of monitoring, management and administration actions that can be included within a Schedule. Transport bindings for the WIMS protocol are identified in the appendix.</p>

    <p>This document defines the PWG Imaging System State and Counter (ISC) MIB v2.0 that supports monitoring of system-, service-, and subunit-level state and counters on imaging devices (dedicated systems) and imaging servers (multipurpose systems). The ISC MIB can be used for fleet management, enterprise billing, field service, and other applications. The ISC MIB is entirely freestanding, but it also facilitates use of the IETF Host Resources MIB [RFC1514] [RFC2790] and IETF Printer MIB [RFC1759] [RFC3805] for imaging device and imaging server monitoring.

    <h3>PWG 5108.01-2011: PWG MFD Model and Common Semantics v1.0 <a class="badge badge-primary" href="https://ftp.pwg.org/pub/pwg/candidates/cs-sm20-mfdmodel10-20110415-5108.1.pdf">PDF</a></h3>
    <p>This specification presents the concepts, semantics and structure of a generalized model of the hardcopy imaging services provided by a Multifunction Device (MFD), a hardcopy device also known as a Multifunction Peripheral (MFP), a Multifunction Printer (MFP) or an All-in-One. This specification is both an overall introduction to the PWG MFD Model and a description of concepts and Elements common to several MFD Services. It is intended to serve as an orientation to the separate PWG specifications defining the MFD Model. The root Element of an MFD, (i.e., System) and the individual MDF Services (e.g., Copy, Print) are more appropriately covered in their own specifications. This MFD Model and Common Semantics specification is technically aligned with a named version of the PWG MFD XML Schema.
    </p>
    <p>For purposes of this modeling, the services that may be performed by an MFD are: Print, Scan, Copy, FaxIn, FaxOut, EmailIn, EmailOut, Transform and Resource.
    </p>
    <p>This Document defines:
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li>The overall MFD model including the terminology and concepts used in the MFD Service models.
    </li>
    <li>The models of an MFD Service, Job and Document
    </li>
    <li>The &ldquo;Imaging Service&rdquo; complex Elements, representing structures appearing in several Services but because of XML Schema restrictions, not instantiated in any Service; the appropriate Services have parallel structures that include some Service-specific Elements.
    </li>
    <li>The Elements common to several Services, eliminating the need to repeat these definitions in each Service specification.</li>

    <p>Network print devices have evolved to support additional multifunction services, in particular Scan Service. When network Scanners are installed in local office or enterprise networks, they need remote service, device, and job management capabilities so that administrators, operators, and End Users can monitor their health and status. In addition, such network Scanners need remote request for job creation capabilties so that operators ane End Users can create Scan Jobs without depending entirely on local console interfaces.&nbsp; This document defines and semantic model for service, device, and job management and request for job creation for these network Scanners.</p>


    <h3>PWG 5108.03-2009: PWG Network Resource Service Semantic Model and Service Interface v1.0 <a class="badge badge-primary" href="https://ftp.pwg.org/pub/pwg/candidates/cs-sm20-resource10-20090703-5108.03.pdf">PDF</a></h3>
    <p>When network Multifunction Devices are installed in local office or enterprise networks shared by large groups of users, the ability to provide resources such as job tickets pre-configured with userâ€™s intent (Job Resource), professionally prepared Logos, Fonts, Forms, etc, that can be reused by userâ€™s jobs is very important for office document productivity. This specification defines a Resource Service that provides operators and users a convenient way to remotely store, manage resources so that they can be retrieved and shared later through job creation requests to other services of network Multifunction Devices.</p>

    <p>Network print devices have evolved to support additional multifunction services, in particular FaxOutService. When FaxOut Devices are installed in local office or enterprise networks, they need remote service, device, and job management capabilities so that administrators, operators, and end users can monitor their health and status. In addition, such FaxOut Devices need remote job submission capabilities so that operators and end users can create FaxOut Jobs without depending entirely on local console interfaces. This document defines a semantic model for service, device, and job management and job submission for these FaxOut Devices.</p>

    <p>Network print devices have evolved to support additional functions. The Multifunction Device (MFD) includes one or more services such as print, scan, copy and facsimile. The MFD Model and Common Semantics [PWG5108.1] extends the original PWG Semantic Model v1 [PWG5105.1] from printing to all of the services that typically may be performed by an MFD. We refer to a device hosting one or more of these services as an Imaging Device.</p>
    <p>The [PWG5108.1] model extension requires a root element to represent the Imaging Device and to move the print service to be one of the hosted imaging related services. The root of the data model is the System Object. The System Object represents the Imaging Device. The System Object contains the elements that represent the Imaging Device status, description and services. The extension of the model includes bringing in elements that until now were primarily accessed via SNMP. This includes the configuration (i.e., Subunits) and conditions that are represented in the Printer MIB [RFC3805] as entries in the Alert Table (i.e., prtAlertTable). The System Objectâ€™s elements contain information that is not visible via any individual service. For example the Imaging Device total usage counters, all conditions from every service, and all Subunits.</p>
    <p>The Imaging Device hosts a number of services. Many of these services are document related such as print, scan and copy. This specification defines the SystemControlService. The SystemControlService is needed to start (create) services and to restart services that have been previously shut down. It is desirable to be able to monitor and manage an Imaging Device as a whole or all the document related services at once. The Imaging Deviceâ€™s SystemControlService provides this functionality.</p>


    <h3>PWG 5108.07-2012: PWG Print Job Ticket and Associated Capabilities Version 1.0 (PJT) <a class="badge badge-primary" href="https://ftp.pwg.org/pub/pwg/candidates/cs-sm20-pjt10-20120801-5108.07.pdf">PDF</a></h3>
    <p>This specification provides the Job Ticket and Capabilities for the Print Service. The Print Service Capabilities are supplied by the Print Service to inform the prospective Print Job Request submitter of the PrintJobTicket elements and element values supported by the Print Service. The PrintJobTicket is supplied by the client, along with Document Data, in a Print Job Request to indicate User intent for the Print Job. The Print Service contains a default PrintJobTicket that provides defaults when the corresponding element is not included with a PrintJob Creation Request.</p>
    <p>The PrintJobTicket datatype is used by several elements including those that: represent the defaults of the Print Service, represent the user intent in a PrintJob Creation Request, and within the resulting Job Object representing the accepted print intent. A closely related datatype, the Print Service Capabilities, represents which PrintJobTicket elements are supported and what values are permitted. The PWG Semantic Model PrintJobTicket datatype, the associated Print Service Capabilities datatypes and their various instantiations are represented as a subset of the PWG Semantic Model v2 XML Schema. This specification also identifies certain Print Service Description elements relate to formatting the Document.</p>
